# Hi, My name is Neil! 

## I'm currently a 22 year old student at the University of Toronto, completing my third year of a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics.
#### I'm proficient in Python, with 5 years of experience, and have intermediate knowledge in Java and Javascript. At the moment, I am using (and learning) Golang, Docker, AWS, and SQL 

## Experience
I completed a year-long co-op working as a Backend Software Developer for [KOHO Financial](https://www.koho.ca/), as a part of the team responsible for creating the different subscription tiers offered by the company. I was mainly responsible for building tools and writing scripts to assist in backfilling user data to the new or revamped tiers created by the team. I also gained experience in bugfixing and writing robust unit and integration tests, as well as best practices for writing clear and effective documentation. I thoroughly enjoyed my time working at KOHO and built long-lasting relations with so many new people I otherwise never would have gotten to meet!

Previously, I have also worked part-time as a Coding Instructor for the company [Code Ninjas in Brampton, ON](https://www.codeninjas.com/brampton-south-west-on-ca) where I would guide young children through a program on learning to code mainly in JavaScript and a little bit of Python.

## Past Projects
In previous years, I've made a demo for a "Social Media Website" I call [```LinkUp```](https://github.com/neil-mehta-code/LinkUp_Social_Media_Website.git). I created this project back in my senior year of High School as my final project for my Computer Science class, and then spent a while updating it as I went because it was something I was really proud of. But with how far I've come now, I look back at the project and see several things I could have done better from the start. It now mostly acts as a memento for myself, to remind me of where and how I started, and how far I've come - both as a developer and as a person.

More recently, I've been expanding my knowledge base and trying to learn a few more programming languages, primarily Java and JavaScript. I built a [weather forecaster](https://github.com/neil-mehta-code/weather_forecaster_final) using React and wrapping around the [OpenWeatherMap Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). It's a very small, very simple project that I made just to get familiar with the major aspects of web development.

There are more projects I have completed, mainly for school, however due to potential Academic Offences (i.e., plagiarism) and Copyright Infringement, I have chosen to not display them on GitHub.

## More About Me

As I continue to grow and advance in my career, I am hoping to be able to work in biotechnology, developing AI or ML programs and/or platforms to provide us with deeper understanding into genetic and other types of illnesses and diseases.

I love playing both board and video games. I recently built [my very first desktop computer](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/b/zcJbt6), and I enjoyed every second of it - sometimes I think about dismantling it all just to build it again. I love to read, watch football (soccer), and code!

Here's a list of my top 5 favourite (video) games of all time, ranked in no particular order:
- [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/about-minecraft) üü´
- [Marvel's Spiderman (PS4)](https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/games/marvels-spider-man/) üï∏Ô∏è
- [The Uncharted Series](https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/uncharted/) ü§µ
