# Hi, My name is Neil! 

## I'm currently a 20 year old student at the University of Toronto, completing my third year of a double major in Mathematical Sciences and Computer Science.
#### I'm pretty proficient in Python, with 5 years of experience, and am learning Java and Javascript (both in and out of school).

Currently, I work part-time as a Coding Instructor for the company [Code Ninjas](https://www.codeninjas.com/brampton-south-west-on-ca) in Brampton, ON.

## Past Projects
In previous years, I've made a demo for a "Social Media Website" I call [```LinkUp```](https://github.com/neil-mehta-code/LinkUp_Social_Media_Website.git). I created this project back in my senior year of High School as my final project for my Computer Science class, and then spent a while updating it as I went because it was something I was really proud of. But with how far I've come now, I look back at the project and see several things I could have done better from the start. It now mostly acts as a memento for myself, to remind me of where and how I started, and how far I've come - both as a developer and as a person.

More recently, I've been expanding my knowledge base and trying to learn a few more programming languages, primarily JavaScript. I built a [weather forecaster](https://github.com/neil-mehta-code/weather_forecaster_final) using React and wrapping around the [OpenWeatherMap Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). It's a very small, very simple project that I made just to get familiar with the aspects of web development.

## More About Me
I love playing both board and video games. I recently built [my very first desktop computer](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/b/zcJbt6), and I enjoyed every second of it - sometimes I think about dismantling it all just to build it again. I love to read, watch football (soccer), and, of course, code!

Here's a list of my top 5 favourite (video) games of all time, ranked in no particular order:
- [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/about-minecraft) üü´
- [Marvel's Spiderman (PS4)](https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/games/marvels-spider-man/) üï∏Ô∏è
- [The Uncharted Series](https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/uncharted/) ü§µ
- [Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice](https://store.steampowered.com/app/814380/Sekiro_Shadows_Die_Twice__GOTY_Edition/) üê∫
- [Mario Kart (Wii)](https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_Kart_Wii) üçÑ
